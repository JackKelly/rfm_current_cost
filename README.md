Please see the comments at the top of `main.cpp` for details.

Please note that this code is no longer being actively developed because it has been superceded by my
[rfm_edf_ecomanager code](https://github.com/JackKelly/rfm_edf_ecomanager)
(which runs on a Nanode with a 433MHz RFM12b RF module).  Please see my blog post
["Summary of my energy monitoring code"](http://jack-kelly.com/summary_of_my_energy_monitoring_code)
for details of my energy monitoring code.
